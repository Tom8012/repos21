## üî• DevOps Interview Questions for 3 Years Experience

### üß∞ Tools & Automation

**1. What CI/CD tools have you used, and how have you implemented pipelines?**
**Answer:**

> "I‚Äôve worked with Jenkins and GitHub Actions. I created pipelines for build, test, Docker image creation, and deployment to staging/prod. I‚Äôve written Jenkinsfiles using scripted and declarative syntax, and integrated Slack notifications for pipeline status."

---

**2. What‚Äôs the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile?**
**Answer:**

* `CMD` provides default arguments to a container but can be overridden at runtime.
* `ENTRYPOINT` sets the main executable, making the container behave like a single command.

> Example: You often combine them to make `ENTRYPOINT` the command and `CMD` the args.

---

**3. How do you handle environment-specific configurations in your deployments?**
**Answer:**

* Use separate config files or variables for each environment.
* Inject them via Ansible vars, Helm values, or CI/CD pipeline variables.
* Use secret managers for sensitive values.

---

**4. How do you roll back a failed deployment in your setup?**
**Answer:**

* In Kubernetes: use `kubectl rollout undo`
* In Jenkins or GitHub Actions: deploy the last successful build artifact
* Blue-green or Canary deployments simplify rollback by just switching traffic back

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure

**5. What cloud platforms have you worked with? What services have you used?**
**Answer:**

> "I've worked mainly on AWS. I‚Äôve used EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, EKS, and CloudWatch. I‚Äôve deployed infrastructure using Terraform, created EC2 instances with Ansible, and containerized apps using ECR and ECS."

---

**6. Can you describe a Terraform project you've built?**
**Answer:**

> "I wrote Terraform code to create VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and an RDS DB. I used modules and remote state storage with S3 and DynamoDB for state locking."

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Monitoring & Security

**7. What tools have you used for monitoring and alerting?**
**Answer:**

> "I‚Äôve used Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application metrics, along with AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure monitoring. Alerts were configured to notify via email and Slack."

---

**8. How do you handle secrets securely in pipelines or config management?**
**Answer:**

> "I use environment variables in CI tools, and secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault. I avoid hardcoding sensitive values and use Ansible Vault to encrypt secrets when needed."

---

### üí° Problem Solving & Scenarios

**9. Scenario: Your CI pipeline fails at the test stage. What steps do you take?**
**Answer:**

* Check test logs in Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
* Reproduce the issue locally with the same environment.
* Check for dependency or version issues.
* Collaborate with developers to fix and re-trigger the build.

---

**10. Scenario: Production site is slow. Where do you start troubleshooting?**
**Answer:**

> "Check monitoring dashboards for CPU/memory usage, database latency, or network errors. Look at logs via ELK stack or CloudWatch. If app-specific, check Kubernetes pod logs and resource limits. Roll back if recent changes correlate with the issue."

Great ‚Äî you're looking for **DevOps interview questions focused on Ansible**, tailored for someone with **\~3 years of experience**. Below is a list of **real-world, technical, and scenario-based questions**, with **sample answers** to help you prepare confidently.

## üîß Ansible Interview Questions (for 3 Years Experience)

### üß† **Conceptual Understanding**

**1. What is Ansible and how does it work?**
**Answer:**
Ansible is an agentless automation tool that uses SSH to connect to remote machines and execute tasks described in YAML playbooks. It uses modules to manage resources and is idempotent, meaning running the same playbook multiple times gives the same result.

---

**2. What is the difference between a playbook, a role, and a task?**
**Answer:**

* **Playbook**: A YAML file with a list of plays to execute on hosts.
* **Task**: A single unit of work (e.g., install a package).
* **Role**: A structured directory containing tasks, vars, handlers, etc., used for reuse and organization.

---

**3. What are handlers in Ansible? When are they triggered?**
**Answer:**
Handlers are special tasks that run **only when notified** by other tasks (e.g., restarting a service after a config change). They're executed at the end of a play.

---

**4. How do you manage secrets in Ansible?**
**Answer:**

* Use **Ansible Vault** to encrypt files or variables:

  ```bash
  ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
  ```
* Vault-encrypted files can be used like regular variables but are secure.

---

**5. What are facts in Ansible? How do you use them?**
**Answer:**
Facts are system information gathered automatically by Ansible (`ansible_facts`). You can use them for conditionals or templates:

```yaml
when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'RedHat'
```

---

### üîß **Hands-on & Syntax-Based**

**6. How do you pass variables to a playbook?**
**Answer:**

* CLI: `ansible-playbook site.yml -e "user=ec2-user"`
* From a vars file: `vars_files: [ "vars.yml" ]`
* Inventory variables

---

**7. What is the difference between `command` and `shell` modules?**
**Answer:**

* `command`: Executes a command **without shell processing** (no `|`, `>`, `&&`).
* `shell`: Executes via a shell, allowing redirection, pipelines, etc.

---

**8. How do you check for idempotency in your playbooks?**
**Answer:**

* Use built-in modules (like `ansible.builtin.package`) that are idempotent by default.
* Avoid `command/shell` when a module exists.
* Use `creates:` or `removes:` to prevent re-running a command unnecessarily.

---

### üì¶ **Scenario-Based Ansible Questions**

**9. Scenario: You need to install different packages on RHEL and Ubuntu. What do you do?**
**Answer:**
Use conditionals based on OS facts:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Apache on RedHat
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'RedHat'

  - name: Install Apache on Debian
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
```

---

**10. Scenario: You get a "FAILED! => unreachable" error. What are the possible reasons?**
**Answer:**

* SSH unreachable (wrong IP, firewall, or port)
* Wrong user or key in inventory
* Host is down
* Network not configured (e.g., AWS Security Group issue)

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Real-World Tasks**

**11. How do you write an Ansible playbook to deploy a web app (Nginx + code)?**

```yaml
- name: Deploy web app
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Copy website files
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: ./website/
        dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/
        mode: 0755

    - name: Start Nginx
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

---

**12. How do you debug a playbook that‚Äôs not behaving as expected?**
**Answer:**

* Use `-vvv` for verbose output.
* Add `ansible.builtin.debug` statements.
* Use `check_mode: yes` to simulate without making changes.
* Use `ansible.builtin.assert` to validate expectations.
