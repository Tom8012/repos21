Disadvantage	Impact
Poor error handling	Risk of unintended results
Not portable	Incompatibility across systems
Hard to maintain/debug	Increased technical debt
Security vulnerabilities	Susceptible to injection attacks
Limited logic capabilities	Not ideal for complex programs
Silent failures	False sense of success
Dependency on tools	Fragile to environment changes
No built-in testing	Harder to validate functionality

If you’re using shell scripts heavily and facing these limitations, you might want to consider alternatives like Python, Ansible, or Go for better reliability, maintainability, and scalability. Let me know if you'd like a comparison!

When to Use What?
Use Shell Scripts when:

Tasks are small, quick, and run on one machine.

You don’t need error resilience or reusability.

Use Ansible when:

You need to manage multiple servers declaratively.

You want repeatable, idempotent configurations.

You prefer YAML over traditional scripting.

Use Python when:

Your automation requires logic, conditionals, or complex data processing.

You’re integrating APIs, building tools, or handling structured data (JSON, XML, etc.).

You want a robust, testable, and maintainable solution.
